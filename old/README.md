# mlb-led-scoreboard
An LED scoreboard for Major League Baseball. Displays a live scoreboard for your team's game on that day.

Requires a Raspberry PI and an LED board hooked up via the GPIO pins.

## Installation
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ajbowler/mlb-led-scoreboard
pip install mlbgame
```
Install anything else your Pi yells at you for. I needed `python-dev` and a few native extensions for other stuff. Outside of scope of this project but this should at least help point people in the right direction.

### Build the RGBMatrix binaries
Go into the matrix submodule and edit the `HARDWARE_DESC?` setting in `lib/Makefile` based on the docs. I used `adafruit-hat` since I'm using an Adafruit HAT.

Go back up to the root directory (`mlb-led-scoreboard/`) and run `make` to get the RGBMatrix binaries.

## Usage
`python main.py` You might have to sudo for the matrix to work.

### Flags
```
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-t TEAM, --team TEAM  Pick a team to display a game for. Example: "Cubs"
-r, --rotate          Rotate through each game of the day every 15 seconds

```
If `--team` isn't provided, the first game in the list of games MLB returns is used.

If you want to rotate through the games of the day, supply a `--rotate` or `-r` flag as a second argument. Currently you must also provide a starting team as the first argument, this will change in the future.

The display will go to the next game every 15 seconds.

`python main.py Cardinals --rotate`

## Example
`python main.py Cubs`

## Sources
This project relies on two libraries:
[MLBGame](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame) is the Python library used for retrieving live game data.
[rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) is the library used for making everything work with the LED board and is included as a submodule, so when cloning, make sure you add `--recursive`.

## 2017-2018 Offseason
Since it's currently the offseason I'm hardcoding everything to random games for testing purposes. I'll update to be "today's game" when the season starts otherwise this thing is useless. I can't guarantee accurate data until it starts either.

## Demo
Here are some images of it in action!
